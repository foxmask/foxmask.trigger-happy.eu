Hi, 

Here is a very short short short post to explain how to get the PyCharm Pro edition and feel like at home. 
And ... this is completely legal

I suppose you use PyCharm Community edition to write your code in Python / Django, but now it is not enough for you.

Pre requisites :

* you participate to a opensource project as core dev or are a leader of one
* Project must be at least 3 months old
* Project is in active development
* Project does not provide commercial service

if it's your case :

* [download the pro version](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)
* then request your licence [by selecting apply under 'For Regular Projects'](https://www.jetbrains.com/buy/opensource/?product=pycharm)

Once you get confirmation by mail, [create an account](https://account.jetbrains.com/) on jetbrains to activate the licence.

At the cherry on the cake : this licence works for ALL THE IDE of jetBrains, even RubyMine and PhpStorm if you want.

for example, you download RubyMine, and at the licence request, fill it with your account and go ;)
