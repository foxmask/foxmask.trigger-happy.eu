## Theme pelican-bootstrap3

this one provide tipue_search plugin but this one provide a version of Tipue which is outdated (version 4) and buggy.
version 5 works fine. To install it, just clone https://github.com/Tipue/Tipue-Search, remove from website/output/theme/tipuesearch and, in place of this one,add the tipuesearch coming from the clone you just made.
